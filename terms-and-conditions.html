                <p>In order to be eligible for using the Service, you may only create an account via our website. In accordance with our Privacy Policy, in order to register, create and use an account, the Company may require that you submit certain personal information, including but not limited to your name, citizenship, email address, text-enabled cell/wireless telephone number, residential address, or zip/postal code, date of birth, and appropriate government issued photo ID number (passport, driver's license, country ID card) to Cabbagino.

                <h3>Types of Accounts</h3>
                <p>We offer two different types of accounts: Personal and Business. You may have only one personal account. Some features of Personal Accounts may be limited based on how you wish to use the Service, how much you need to send and what information has been provided to us. We may require that you provide additional information in order to complete a transaction. Business, commercial or merchant transactions shall not be conducted using Personal Accounts. For each business you are involved with, you may have only one associated Business Account; usage is limited based on your current verification status. Business Accounts must be applied for and explicitly authorized by Cabbagino. By opening a Business Account and accepting the terms set out in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Rules and Restrictions for Business Accounts set forth below, you attest that neither you nor your business is establishing a Business Account primarily for personal, family or household purposes. We may reverse or place a hold on your transactions or place a reserve on your funds if you are in breach of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, using a personal account for business purposes or a business account for personal, family or household purposes.</p>
                <h3>Identity Authentication</h3>
                <p>You hereby authorize Cabbagino, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity and/or authenticate your identity and account information and, for business accounts, your company or employer. This may include a request for further information and/or documentation about your account usage or identity, or a confirmation of ownership of stated email, telephone number, or financial instruments, and verifying your information via third party databases or other sources.</p>
                <h3>Transaction History</h3>
                <p>You may have access to your transaction history by logging into your Cabbagino account. You agree to review your transaction history online instead of receiving periodic statements sent by mail.</p>
                <h3>Sending Limits</h3>
                <p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can send or receive using the Services. Please contact our customer service for more details on limits. If we have authenticated your identity, we may increase your sending and/or receiving limits. These limits may change from time to time at our sole discretion.</p>
                <h3>Funding/Withdrawing Sources</h3>
                <p>Your Cabbagino account balance consists of the funds you have in your Cabbagino account that are available for new transfers or withdrawals and are not subject to pending transactions. When you make a payment or withdrawal from your Cabbagino account, the system automatically checks if your Cabbagino account balance can cover the transaction. You can top up your Cabbagino account via bank wire, debit card or credit card, or other approved deposit option. These deposited funds, once cleared, will then be available for future transfers. Transactions will only be made if your Cabbagino account is sufficient to cover your payment. If there is not enough funds available in your Cabbagino account to cover the transaction, we prompt you to use your designated primary funding source to top up your account balance and make the payment in its entirety. If you do not wish to use your balance, you may choose to have it remain as a balance or you can withdraw it at any time.</p>
                <h3>Funding Source Limitations</h3>
                <p>In order to manage risk, Cabbagino may limit the funding sources available for your usage. For instance, we may limit your funding sources for a particular transaction to debit cards or your current account. Please note that the various funding sources have different dispute resolution means should your transaction turn out to be unsatisfactory.</p>
                <h3>Bank Transfers</h3>
                <p>When your Everyday Banking Account is used as your funding source, you are requesting that we initiate on your behalf an electronic transfer from your bank account. For these transactions, we will make electronic transfers from your bank account in the amount you specify. You agree that such requests constitute your authorization to the Company to make the transfer, and once you have provided your authorization for the transfer, you will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer and Cabbagino may resubmit any debit you authorized that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds, except as otherwise provided by applicable law. If you use your credit or debit card to fund your Cabbagino account, the card issuers may view such transactions as a cash advance and charge a fee. Cabbagino will not be held liable for such charges and user takes on sole responsibility for honouring such charges.</p>
                <h3>Refunded Transactions</h3>
                <p>When you transfer money, the recipient is not required to accept it. You agree that you will not hold Cabbagino liable for any damages resulting from a recipient’s decision not to accept a transaction made through the Service.</p>
                <p>A recipient of Cabbagino funds may not immediately accept funds. During this period, a hold will be placed on your account for the amount of the transfer and the applicable fee, if any. Once the recipient has successfully accepted the transaction, transfers will automatically be debited from your account and credited into the recipient’s account. You also have the option of cancelling your payment at any time using the Service before acceptance by the recipient. If a payment is unclaimed, denied or refunded for any reason, we will return the money to your balance or to the original funding source.</p>
                <h3>Card Processing</h3>
                <p>We will process your debit card funded transactions through either the debit card's ATM debit network or the Visa/MasterCard network, as we may choose at our discretion.</p>
                <h3>Card Information</h3>
                <p>If your credit card account number changes or your credit card expiration date changes, we may acquire that information from our financial services partner and update your account.</p>
                <h3>Fees and Limits for Sending and Receiving Money</h3>
                <p>ou may use the Services to send money funded by your Cabbagino account balance. Fees charged may change from time to time at our sole discretion. You may be subject to third party fees, such as insufficient fund fees, reversal, or other fees that a bank may charge if your payment is rejected.</p>
                <p>Cabbagino may also, at its sole discretion, impose daily, weekly or monthly limits on the amount of money that can be sent or received through the application. These limits are usually, though not always, based on local regulations.</p>
                <h3>Payment Investigation</h3>
                <p>Payment investigation is a process by which Cabbagino reviews certain potentially high risk transactions. If a payment is subject to payment investigation, the Company will place a hold on the payment and may provide notice to the recipient. The Company will conduct a review and either clear or cancel the payment. If the payment is cleared, we will provide a respectove notice to the recipient. Otherwise, the Company will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned. We will provide notice to you by email and/or in the account history tab of your Cabbagino account if the payment is canceled.</p>
                <h3>Risk of Reversals, Chargebacks and Claims</h3>
                <p>When you receive a payment, you are liable to us for the full amount of the payment plus any fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason. This means that, in addition to any other liability, you will be responsible for the amount of the payment, plus applicable fees if you lose a claim or a chargeback, or if there is a reversal of the payment. If a sender of a payment later disputes the payment or files a claim for a chargeback, the debit or credit card issuer or the originating bank, not the Company, will determine whether the dispute is valid and to whom the payment is due. You agree to allow Cabbagino to recover any amounts due to us by debiting your balance. If there are insufficient funds in your balance to cover your liability, you agree to reimburse the Company through other means. If Cabbagino is unable to recover the funds from your primary funding source, we will attempt to contact you. Cabbagino may recover the funds from any other funding sources, or may take other legal actions to collect the amount due, to the extent allowed by applicable law.</p>
                <h3>Account Balance</h3>
                <p>If you do hold a balance, we will hold your funds separate from our corporate funds, and we will not use your funds for our operating expenses. It will not voluntarily make your funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. While your funds are in our custody, Cabbagino will combine your funds with the funds of other users and place those pooled accounts in one or more bank accounts in Cabbagino’s name or in other liquid securities, etc.</p>
                <p>The Company is not a bank or other chartered depository institution; it offers online digital banking type services. Funds held by the Company or its service providers, including any bank service providers, in connection with the processing of transactions are not deposit obligations and are not insured for the benefit of the user by any governmental agency.</p>
                <h3>Assignment of Interest to Cabbagino</h3>
                <p>You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the Everyday Banking funds that Cabbagino handles and places in pooled accounts or other securities. In consideration of your use of the service, you irrevocably transfer and assign to Cabbagino any ownership right that you may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in pooled accounts. This assignment applies only to interest earned on your funds, and nothing in this Agreement grants the Company any ownership right to the principal of the funds you maintain with us.</p>
                <h3>Setoff of Past Due Amounts</h3>
                <p>If you have, for whatever reason, a past due amount owed to Cabbagino, we will make attempts on your funding source or Cabbagino balance to cover the amounts. If Cabbagino is unable to recover the funds, we will attempt to contact you. Cabbagino may recover the funds from any funding sources, or may take other legal actions to collect any amounts that are more than 14 (fourteen) days past due, to the extent allowed by applicable law.</p>
                <h3>Security Interest</h3>
                <p>To secure your performance of this Agreement, you hereby grant to Cabbagino a lien on and security interest in your account and agree to execute any further documentation to perfect these company rights.</p>
                <h3>Adding Money</h3>
                <p>You may add funds to your Cabbagino account by transferring funds from your credit or debit card, bank account or other approved funding source. We may also limit top-up amounts based on MAS regulations or at our sole discretion.</p>
                <p>Cabbagino also reserves the right to charge users a fee for topping up their Cabbagino account. The nature and extent of such fees are at the sole discretion of Cabbagino.</p>
                <p>Cabbagino will make every effort to inform users of such charges through all available channels such as email, push and in-app messaging.</p>
                <p>As we sometimes channel our credit card processing with Overseas Banks, your bank may charge you an international FX fee or overseas transaction fee. We are not liable for these fees.</p>
                <p>The Company is also not liable for instances where your bank may classify a top-up as a “cash advance.”</p>
                <h3>Withdrawal Limits</h3>
                <p>We reserve the right to delay withdrawals while we screen for risk, or request you provide additional information to verify your identity and we may limit the amount you can withdraw until the information is verified.</p>
                <p>We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can withdraw from your Cabbagino account within a given time frame. These limits may change from time to time at our sole discretion.</p>
                <p>Cabbagino also reserves the right to impose fees or charges on withdrawals at its sole discretion. We will make every effort to inform users of such charges through all available channels such as email, push and in-app messaging.</p>
                <h3>Withdrawing Money</h3>
                <p>You may withdraw funds from your Cabbagino account by electronically transferring them to your bank account. We may provide limited withdrawals to your debit card depending on what product is enabled and approved on your account. We may also limit withdrawal amounts based on MAS regulations and at our sole discretion.</p>
                <p>When you transfer funds from your Cabbagino account balance to your linked financial institution account(-s), applicable Law and Rules will govern the transfer.</p>
                <h3>Closing Account</h3>
                <p>As long as there are no pending or in progress transactions, you may close your account at any time by contacting us in writing or via email and requesting a closure of your Cabbagino account. Any remaining balance, pending fees and clearance from Cabbagino, will be sent to the user via bank transfer to the bank account on file, unless otherwise instructed. Customer information will be held in our database for a minimum period of 5 (five) years.</p>
                <p>You may not close your account to evade a payment investigation. If you attempt to close your account while we are conducting an investigation, we may hold your funds for up to 180 (one hundred eighty) days to protect Cabbagino or a third party against the risk of reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties or other liabilities. You will remain liable for all obligations related to your account even after the account is closed.</p>
                <p>Any balances held in your Cabbagino account at the time of account closure will be refunded to you via bank transfer after any deduction of fees or charges. Settlement of existing balance will not be handled by a cash settlement at anytime.</p>
                <h3>Item Hold</h3>
                <p>Cabbagino, in its sole discretion, may place a hold on a payment you receive for a transaction when we believe there may be a high level of risk associated with the transaction. If Cabbagino places a hold on your payment, it will show as “pending” in your Cabbagino account.</p>
                <p>We will release any held payment after 21 days unless we receive a dispute, claim, charge-back, or reversal on the transaction subject to the hold. We may release the hold earlier if the sender of funds provides us confirmation, Cabbagino is able to confirm proper delivery, or Cabbagino otherwise completes its investigation.</p>
                <p>If you receive a dispute, claim, chargeback, or reversal on the transaction subject to the item hold, Cabbagino may hold the payment in your account until the matter is resolved pursuant to this Agreement.</p>
                <p>For high volume accounts, including Business Accounts, Cabbagino may, in its sole discretion, place a reserve on funds held in your account when it believes there may be a high level of risk associated with your account. If your account is subject to a reserve, we will provide you with notice specifying the terms of the reserve. The terms may require that a certain percentage of the amounts received into your account are held for a certain period of time, or that a certain amount of money is held in reserve, or anything else that Cabbagino determines is necessary to protect against the risk associated with your account. We may change the terms of the reserve at any time by providing you with notice of the new terms.</p>
                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, we have the right to prohibit your access to the Services, including without limitation by deactivating your username and password, and to refuse future access to Cabbagino account(-s) by you or if a business entity, its parent, affiliates or subsidiaries or its or their successors.</p>

                <h3>Loss or Theft of Account Information, PIN, or Mobile Device</h3>

                <h3>Account Closure, Termination of Service, or Limited Account Access</h3>
                <p>If we limit or close your account or terminate your use of our Service for any reason, you may contact us and request restoration of access if appropriate.

You acknowledge and agree that a fine of S$2,500.00 for violations of our Agreement is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of Cabbagino's damages, considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to Cabbagino that reasonably could be anticipated and the anticipation that proof of actual damages may be impractical or extremely difficult. Cabbagino may deduct such fines directly from any existing balance in the offending account, or any other Cabbagino account you control.</p>

                <h3>Law and Forum for Disputes, Arbitration</h3>
                <p>This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of Singapore, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
                <p>ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THIS USER AGREEMENT MUST BE ASSERTED INDIVIDUALLY IN BINDING ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR WITH EXPERIENCE IN CONSUMER ONLINE PAYMENT SERVICES DISPUTES ADMINISTERED BY THE SINGAPORE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION CENTER (“SIAC”) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SIAC SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES.</p>
                <p>The forum for arbitration shall be in the city closest to your residence having a federal district courthouse. The arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class or collective arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals. To the extent allowed by applicable law, the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this User Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. For any non-frivolous claim, Cabbagino will pay the costs of the arbitration (but not your attorney fees), up to USD 1,000. This Agreement and each of its parts evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce, and International Arbitration Act shall apply in all cases and govern the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration rules and arbitration proceedings. There are only two exceptions to this arbitration Agreement. First, if we reasonably believe that you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. Second, any claim of USD 500 or less may, at the option of the claiming party, be resolved in small claims court in Singapore, if the claim and the parties are within the jurisdiction of the small claims court. For these two exceptions, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Singapore for the purpose of litigating such claims or disputes.</p>
                <p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, YOU AGREE TO IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR OTHER COURT TRIAL (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT) OR TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING FILED AGAINST US AND/OR RELATED THIRD PARTIES.</p>
                <h3>Liability of the Company for Failure to Complete Transfers</h3>
                <p>If the Company does not complete a transfer to or from your account, or using your saved payment information, on time or in the correct amount according to this Agreement, Cabbagino will be liable for your losses or damages to the extent required by law. However, the Company is not responsible for the actions of the persons to whom you send a transfer, or from whom you receive a transfer. Additionally, the Company will not be liable:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>if, through no fault of Cabbagino, you do not have enough money in your balance, and Cabbagino is unable to charge the transaction to your linked credit card, for reasons including but not limited to you exceeding any applicable credit limit;</li>
                    <li>the funds in your account are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting their use;</li>
                    <li>if the Services were not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer;</li>
                    <li>if the failure results from a failure of a financial institution that issues the credit card or debit card linked to your account, or Cabbagino is unable to access a linked credit card for any reason other than due to Cabbagino's fault;</li>
                    <li>if you provided inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the transfer;</li>
                    <li>If the transfer appears suspicious, fraudulent, or unauthorized, and Cabbagino cannot confirm that it is a legitimate transfer, or if the account of either user involved in the transfer is under investigation by Cabbagino or if the transfer is or appears to be prohibited by any applicable law or rules;</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Disclaimers of Warranty and Damages Exclusions</h3>
                <p>Unless otherwise prohibited by law, you assume all responsibility for your use of the Services, and any other service provided under this Agreement and use it at your own risk. To the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, all such representations, warranties, guarantees and conditions are disclaimed, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement of intellectual property rights, or other terms which might otherwise be implied by statute, common law or in equity. Cabbagino does not warrant that the services will be uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that the services, or the servers that process information for the services, are free of viruses, bugs or other harmful components.

Neither Cabbagino, the Covered Third Parties nor any of their respective affiliates, vendors, agents or suppliers will be liable for, and you agree not to seek against any of the foregoing, any damages of any kind arising from the use of the Services, including, but not limited to, indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, consequential damages or damages resulting from the use of the Services, loss of use of the Services, lost data, lost profits, or business interruption arising out of or in any way connected with the use of the Services, any delays in the Services, or the inability to use the Services, or any portion thereof, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, even if all or any of us have been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
                <p>For the Services, Cabbagino will make reasonable efforts to ensure that all requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, credit cards, and other funding or withdrawal sources are processed in a timely manner but Cabbagino makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing as Cabbagino is dependent upon many factors outside of its control, such as delays in the banking system or the Singapore or international mail services.</p>
                <p>OTHER JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</p>
                <h3>Limitations on Liability</h3>
                <p>Except as otherwise EXPRESSLY provided in this agreement, and to the extent permissible under applicable law, Cabbagino's cumulative liability to you for any claims or damages arising out of or related to your use of the Services shall not exceed the greater of the fee you paid to Cabbagino for the use of the Services or USD 1.00.</p>
                <p>These limitations on liability apply to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>anything related to a service or any application or content made available through any such service;</li>

                </ul>
                <p>These limitations on liability also apply even if repair, replacement or a refund for the service does not fully compensate you for any losses, or Cabbagino or a Covered Third Party knew or should have known, about the possibility of the damages. These limitations on liability will apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some states or other jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability so the foregoing limitations may not apply to you. You may also have other rights that vary from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction.</p>
